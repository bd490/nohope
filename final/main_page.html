<p>Red sun, red sun over paradise, Red sun, red sun over paradise
    Golden rays of the glorious sunshine
    Sending down such a blood-red light
    Now, the animals slowly retreat to the shadows, out of sight
    Arid winds blow across the mountains
    Giving flight to the birds of prey
    In the distance machines come to transform Eden, day by day
    Only love is with us now
    Something warm and pure
    Find the peace within ourselves
    No need for a cure
    When the wind is slow, when the fire's hot
    The vulture waits to see what rots
    Oh, how pretty, all the scenery
    This is nature's sacrifice
    When the air blows through with a brisk attack
    The reptile tail ripped from its back
    When the sun sets
    We will not forget the red sun over paradise
    Red sun</p>
